# Community

If you're interested in the project, you're welcome to drop by!  Check out [ways in which you can contribute](/contribute).

Please remember that all community members are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Discord

Most development and project discussion takes place on Discord. We have several channels on our Discord:

* #dragon-linux [[chat](https://discord.go.venith.net/dragon)] - General project discussion
* #dragon-dev [[chat](https://discord.go.venith.net/dragon-dev)] - Development discussion
* #dragon-stream [[watch](https://twitch.go.venith.net) - Chatroom for people to talk during the devs' video streams

Even if you don't plan to speak, feel free to join and idle in the above channels if you'd like to follow the discussion.

## Mastodon (Fediverse)

You will also find official announcements and information on the [Dragon Linux Mastodon account](https://nerdculture.de/@astafathersatan).
