## The Dragons have arisen!

Dragon Linux 6.1 is now released! We plan to have MUCH more stable release times now.

## Release Notes

Every major Ubuntu version will have a rebase. While we do NOT have a built in updater to go between versions like Mint does, you can always apt upgrade. We will correct boot branding on the next release.
