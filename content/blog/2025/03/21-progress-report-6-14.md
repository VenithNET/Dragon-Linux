## Sample Text
WIP - REDO

As March draws to a close and Linux 6.14 nears release, now is a good time to
provide you all with our first major progress update since [taking the lead on
the project](https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/). Going forward,
we hope to keep these updates in sync with upstream kernel releases. We feel
that this is a natural cadence given the focus on upstreaming, with enough time
between posts for noteworthy downstream changes to accumulate.

After getting through all the administrative work required to keep the lights
on after marcan's departure, we've hit the ground running with upstream patch
submission. We held our first board meeting under interesting circumstances,
and we've even managed to sneak a couple of new features in downstream
while you weren't looking. So, without further ado, let's get into it.

## Our first board meeting
We held our inaugural board meeting on 7 March, under challenging conditions
for some. Neal and Davide battled crappy conference hall WiFi while at Southern
California Linux Expo, while I sat in the dark with no power as Tropical Cyclone
Alfred ravaged Southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales. Despite this,
we managed to get through quite a bit. You can find the meeting minutes
[here](https://asahilinux.org/docs/project/board/minutes/20250307).
